/**

 * Obviously, we can extrapolate this to neighbors of neighbors and so on. Then a node window around a node
 * with (X, Y) "coordinates" of size W (odd integer) is a set of nodes in the square with side W and central
 * point (X, Y). More formally a node window around (X, Y) node of size W is a set of nodes in a square with opposite
 * vertices (X - (W-1)/2, Y - (W-1)/2) and (X + (W-1)/2, Y + (W-1)/2). <br><br>

 *
 * @param node Pointer to the node to get node window around
